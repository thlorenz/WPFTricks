Collection of projects which each shows a simple example for doing somewhat more involved things with WPF.
  1. Callbacks Project
      - demonstrates the use of DependencyProperties that are functions and can be bound to the ViewModel
      - in this contrived example it is used in order to implement validation
  2. Validation Project
      - demonstrates the declarative validation setup by using the Validating part of the Shared Project
  3. Resizing Controls
      - demonstrates resize behavior implemented as attached property and also by using Interactivity in order to compare both approaches
  
  Most of the above sample projects make use of tools inside the Shared Project.
